# FCC Projects

Projects for freeCodeCamp will not be hosted on github pages, instead, I will leave them in my codepen.

## [Pomodoro Clock]()

Seems simple enough, I'm not really taking it serious, gonna prolly bite me in the ass.

---

## [Calculator](https://codepen.io/Romchy/pen/jZGXOG)

Complicated.

---

## [Twitch API](https://codepen.io/Romchy/pen/vdZwJQ)

Using twitch API to display active channels.
This one gave me some problems because I couldn't display items in order, so working around that was quite tough.
Even after figuring it out I don't think it works optimally.
It's hard to know where I get all the inconsistency, it must be the API which probably can't handle too many requests, unfortunately I can't lower them.

## [Wikpedia viewer](https://codepen.io/Romchy/pen/eVROGE)

Interesting project. Not really that much JS to write.

---

## [Weather app](https://codepen.io/Romchy/pen/RQVdvV)

~~I have barely started and I am already enjoying this project so much!~~

Very fun project, short and sweet :)

## [Random Quote Generator](https://codepen.io/Romchy/pen/NyjpEK)

Quick set up. Some styles. Nothing fancy.

NEXT!

## [Portfolio](https://codepen.io/Romchy/pen/aqpxzW)

I made a mock up of what a portfolio could look like, it's not on a professional level but more of a stepping stone to great design...perhaps

it was a fun project
